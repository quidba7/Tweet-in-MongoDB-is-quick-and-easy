    "Twitter is really nice as a tool for analysing market sentiment. This Notebook is a quick template to use for collecting tweets from Twitter from either the live firehose or Search API and store them in a MongoDB. As I have been working in Oil & Gas trading, we will use the #OOTT for analysing market sentiment for Oil trading. \n",

    "We will also plot the evolution of tweet flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend reading \"Mining the Social Web\", the code is taken from the book, which is very well done.\n",
    "Hope this Notebook will be useful for people who needs quick and easy to use code sample for analysing Market sentiment from Twitter.\n",
